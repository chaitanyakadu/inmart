## How It Works

Inmart automates the workflow in three steps:

   Decide which leads should be handled using filters and strategies.

   The software automatically purchases, messages, and manages the filterd leads.

3. **Get Notifications:**  
   You are notified once your leads have been processed or responded to.

## Creating Strategies

When setting up Inmart, you can define your own strategies. These determine which leads are handled or rejected.

### Required Filters

1. **Allowed Countries**  
   List of countries whose leads should be accepted.

2. **Restricted Medicines**  
   List of medicines or products that should always be rejected.

3. **Allowed Medicines**  
   Only these medicines or products will be considered for handling.

### Points System

Each lead can be assigned points based on different parameters:

1. WhatsApp Active
2. Mobile Verified
3. Email Verified
4. Buyer Replies
5. Buyer Calls
6. Seconds (lead is < 1min old)

You can use these to set a minimum quality threshold for leads.

### Fundamental Settings

   The least score a lead must have to be handled automatically.

2. **Maximum Leads Handled (1–10 only)**  
   The number of leads Inmart will process in a single batch.
